# Spark Protobuf - Developer Documentation

## Getting Started 

### Build

```bash
./build/mvn clean package
```

or

```bash
./build/sbt clean package
```

### Build with user-defined `protoc`

When the user cannot use the official `protoc` binary files to build the `protobuf` module in the compilation environment,
for example, compiling `protobuf` module on CentOS 6 or CentOS 7 which the default `glibc` version is less than 2.14, we can try to compile and test by 
specifying the user-defined `protoc` binary files as follows:

```bash
export SPARK_PROTOC_EXEC_PATH=/path-to-protoc-exe
./build/mvn -Phive -Puser-defined-protoc clean package
```

or

```bash
export SPARK_PROTOC_EXEC_PATH=/path-to-protoc-exe
./build/sbt -Puser-defined-protoc clean package
```

The user-defined `protoc` binary files can be produced in the user's compilation environment by source code compilation, 
for compilation steps, please refer to [protobuf](https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf).

### Work with IDE

#### IntelliJ IDEA

If you encounter the problem that the JAVA files generated by protobuf are not indexed by IDEA,
and the generated Java classes cannot be found by IDEA, you may need to increase the `idea.max.intellisense.filesize` value of IDEA.
Open Help -> Edit Custom Properties, and add the following configuration:

```bash
idea.max.intellisense.filesize = 10000
```

Then restart IDEA.
