/**
 * A plugin which can be automaticaly instantiated within each Spark executor.  Users can specify
 * plugins which should be created with the "spark.executor.plugins" configuration.  An instance
 * of each plugin will be created for every executor, including those created by dynamic allocation,
 * before the executor starts running any tasks.
 *
 * The specific api exposed to the end users still considered to be very unstable.  We will
 * *hopefully* be able to keep compatability by providing default implementations for any methods
 * added, but make no guarantees this will always be possible across all spark releases.
 *
 * Spark does nothing to verify the plugin is doing legitimate things, or to manage the resources
 * it uses.  A plugin acquires the same privileges as the user running the task.  A bad plugin
 * could also intefere with task execution and make the executor fail in unexpected ways.
