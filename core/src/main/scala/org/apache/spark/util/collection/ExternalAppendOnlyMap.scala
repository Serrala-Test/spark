/**
 * :: DeveloperApi ::
 * An append-only map that spills sorted content to disk when there is insufficient space for it
 * to grow.
 *
 * This map takes two passes over the data:
 *
 *   (1) Values are merged into combiners, which are sorted and spilled to disk as necessary
 *   (2) Combiners are read from disk and merged together
 *
 * The setting of the spill threshold faces the following trade-off: If the spill threshold is
 * too high, the in-memory map may occupy more memory than is available, resulting in OOM.
 * However, if the spill threshold is too low, we spill frequently and incur unnecessary disk
 * writes. This may lead to a performance regression compared to the normal case of using the
 * non-spilling AppendOnlyMap.
 *
 * Two parameters control the memory threshold:
 *
 *   `spark.shuffle.memoryFraction` specifies the collective amount of memory used for storing
 *   these maps as a fraction of the executor's total memory. Since each concurrently running
 *   task maintains one map, the actual threshold for each map is this quantity divided by the
 *   number of running tasks.
 *
 *   `spark.shuffle.safetyFraction` specifies an additional margin of safety as a fraction of
 *   this threshold, in case map size estimation is not sufficiently accurate.
