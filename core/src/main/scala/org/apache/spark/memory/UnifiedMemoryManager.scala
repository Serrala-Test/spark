/**
 * A [[MemoryManager]] that enforces a soft boundary between execution and storage such that
 * either side can borrow memory from the other.
 *
 * The region shared between execution and storage is a fraction of (the total heap space - 300MB)
 * configurable through `spark.memory.fraction` (default 0.75). The position of the boundary
 * within this space is further determined by `spark.memory.storageFraction` (default 0.5).
 * This means the size of the storage region is 0.75 * 0.5 = 0.375 of the heap space by default.
 *
 * Storage can borrow as much execution memory as is free until execution reclaims its space.
 * When this happens, cached blocks will be evicted from memory until sufficient borrowed
 * memory is released to satisfy the execution memory request.
 *
 * Similarly, execution can borrow as much storage memory as is free. However, execution
 * memory is *never* evicted by storage due to the complexities involved in implementing this.
 * The implication is that attempts to cache blocks may fail if execution has already eaten
 * up most of the storage space, in which case the new blocks will be evicted immediately
 * according to their respective storage levels.
