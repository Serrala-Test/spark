/**
 * QueryStageInput is the leaf node of a QueryStage and serves as its input. A QueryStage knows
 * its child stages by collecting all the QueryStageInputs. For a ShuffleQueryStageInput, it
 * controls how to read the ShuffledRowRDD generated by its child stage. It gets the ShuffledRowRDD
 * from its child stage and creates a new ShuffledRowRDD with different partitions by specifying
 * an array of partition start indices. For example, a ShuffledQueryStage can be reused by two
 * different QueryStages. One QueryStageInput can let the first task read partition 0 to 3, while
 * in another stage, the QueryStageInput can let the first task read partition 0 to 1.
