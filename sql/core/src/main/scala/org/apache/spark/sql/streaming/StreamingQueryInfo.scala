/**
 * :: Experimental ::
 * A class used to report information about the progress of a [[StreamingQuery]].
 *
 * @param name The query name. This name is unique across all active queries.
 * @param id The query id. This id is unique across
 *          all queries that have been started in the current process.
 * @param timestamp Timestamp (ms) of when this query was generated
 * @param inputRate Current rate (rows/sec) at which data is being generated by all the sources
 * @param processingRate Current rate (rows/sec) at which the query is processing data from
 *                       all the sources
 * @param outputRate Current rate (rows/sec) at which the query is writing data to the sink
 * @param latency  Current average latency between the data being available in source and the sink
 *                   writing the corresponding output
 * @param sourceStatuses Current statuses of the sources.
 * @param sinkStatus Current status of the sink.
 * @param triggerStatus Low-level detailed status of the last completed/currently active trigger
 * @since 2.0.0
