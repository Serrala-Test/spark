-- Unit tests for simple NOT IN predicate subquery across multiple columns.
--
-- See not-in-single-column-unit-tests.sql for an introduction.
-- This file has the same test cases as not-in-unit-tests-multi-column.sql with literals instead of
-- subqueries. Small changes have been made to the literals to make them typecheck.
