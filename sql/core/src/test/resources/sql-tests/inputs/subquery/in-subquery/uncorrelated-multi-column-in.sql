-- Unit tests for uncorrelated multi-column IN subquery
--
-- Example: `(3, 4) IN (SELECT a, b FROM t WHERE ...)`
-- Assume the subquery returns a result set ((a1, b1), (a2, b2), (a2, b3), ...), then the IN subquery should
-- behave as `(3 = a1 AND 4 = b1) OR (3 = a2 AND 4= b2) OR (3 = a3 AND 4 = b3) OR ...`.
--
-- Test cases for uncorrelated multi-column IN subquery `(a, b) IN (SELECT x, y FROM t ...)`,
-- we have 3 conditions in these tests:
-- C1. exists a tuple makes (a = x AND b = y) return TRUE
-- C2. exists a tuple makes (a = x AND b = y) return FALSE
-- C3. exists a tuple makes (a = x AND b = y) return UNKNOWN
-- | # |  C1  |  C2  |  C3  |  result of the IN subquery |
-- | 1 |  yes |  ?   |   ?  |           TRUE             |
-- | 2 |  no  |  yes |  no  |           FALSE            |
-- | 3 |  no  |  yes |  yes |          UNKNOWN           |
-- | 4 |  no  |  no  |  yes |          UNKNOWN           |
-- | 5 |  empty result set  |           FALSE            |
