/**
 * This is the parsed representation of a relation argument for a TableValuedFunction call.
 * The syntax supports passing such relations one of two ways:
 *
 * 1. SELECT ... FROM tvf_call(TABLE t)
 * 2. SELECT ... FROM tvf_call(TABLE (<query>))
 *
 * In the former case, the relation argument directly refers to the name of a
 * table in the catalog. In the latter case, the relation argument comprises
 * a table subquery that may itself refer to one or more tables in its own
 * FROM clause.
 *
 * Each TABLE argument may also optionally include a PARTITION BY clause. If present, these indicate
 * how to logically split up the input relation such that the table-valued function evaluates
 * exactly once for each partition, and returns the union of all results. If no partitioning list is
 * present, this splitting of the input relation is undefined. Furthermore, if the PARTITION BY
 * clause includes a following ORDER BY clause, Catalyst will sort the rows in each partition such
 * that the table-valued function receives them one-by-one in the requested order. Otherwise, if no
 * such ordering is specified, the ordering of rows within each partition is undefined.
 *
 * @param plan the logical plan provided as input for the table argument as either a logical
 *             relation or as a more complex logical plan in the event of a table subquery.
 * @param outerAttrs outer references of this subquery plan, generally empty since these table
 *                   arguments do not allow correlated references currently
 * @param exprId expression ID of this subquery expression, generally generated afresh each time
 * @param partitionByExpressions if non-empty, the TABLE argument included the PARTITION BY clause
 *                               to indicate that the input relation should be repartitioned by the
 *                               hash of the provided expressions, such that all the rows with each
 *                               unique combination of values of the partitioning expressions will
 *                               be consumed by exactly one instance of the table function class.
 * @param withSinglePartition if true, the TABLE argument included the WITH SINGLE PARTITION clause
 *                            to indicate that the entire input relation should be repartitioned to
 *                            one worker for consumption by exactly one instance of the table
 *                            function class.
 * @param orderByExpressions if non-empty, the TABLE argument included the ORDER BY clause to
 *                           indicate that the rows within each partition of the table function are
 *                           to arrive in the provided order.
