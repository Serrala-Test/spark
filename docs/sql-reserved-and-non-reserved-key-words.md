Reserved key words in Spark SQL basically follow the ANSI SQL-2011 standards, but it is slightly different between each other.
A full list of reserved/non-reserved key words is as follows:

<table class="table">
  <tr><th><b>Key Word</b></th><th><b>Spark SQL</b></th><th><b>SQL-2011</b></th></tr>
  <tr>
    <td>ALL</td><td>reserved</td><td>reserved</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>ANY</td><td>reserved</td><td>reserved</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>XXX</td><td>non-reserved</td><td>reserved</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>YYY</td><td>reserved</td><td>non-reserved</td>
  </tr>
</table>
