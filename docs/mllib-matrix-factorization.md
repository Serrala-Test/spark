#LU Factorization


The LU decomposition is a well studied algorithm for decomposing a matrix into a lower diagonal matrix 
$L$ and an upper diagonal matrix $U$, given as  

`\begin{equation}
    PA = LU\\
        P \begin{pmatrix}
            a_{11}&\cdots  &a_{1n} \\ 
             \vdots& \ddots &\vdots \\ 
             a_{m1}&\cdots  & a_{mn}
        \end{pmatrix} = 
        \begin{pmatrix}
            \ell_{11}&\ 0    &0 \\ 
             \vdots& \ddots &0 \\ 
             \ell_{m1}&\cdots  & \ell_{mn}
            \end{pmatrix}
            \begin{pmatrix}
               0&\ \cdots    &u_{1n} \\ 
             \vdots& \ddots &\vdots\\ 
            0&\cdots  & u_{mn}
        \end{pmatrix},
        \label{eq:generalLUFactorization}
\end{equation}`

where $P$ is a row permutation matrix. [`blockLU()`](api/scala/index.html#org.apache.spark.mllib.linalg.distributed.BlockMatrix) 
returns a Tuple containing the $P,L$ and $U$ [`BlockMatrix`](api/scala/index.html#org.apache.spark.mllib.linalg.distributed.BlockMatrix) 
objects.

This algorithm is a highly stable method for inverting a matrix and solving linear systems of equations that appear in
machine learning applications.  Larger linear equations of the type $AX=B$ are usually solved with SGD, BGFS, or other
gradient based methods.  Solving these equations at scale to numerical precision should open up possiblities for new 
algorithms within MLlib, as well as other applications. 

Once the decomposition is computed, many other quantities can be easily computed, including the solution to a 
linear system of equations via [`BlockMatrix.solve()`](api/scala/index.html#org.apache.spark.mllib.linalg.distributed.BlockMatrix), which is 
described in the next section.

**Example**

{% highlight scala %}
import org.apache.spark.mllib.linalg.distributed.{BlockMatrix}
import org.apache.spark.mllib.linalg.{Matrix=>SparkMatrix,Matrices=>SparkMatrices}
import org.apache.spark.mllib.linalg.{DenseMatrix}

val blocks: RDD[(Int, Int), Matrix] = ... // an RDD of (i,j,m) matrix entries

val rowsPerBlock = 2; val colsPerBlock = 2; 
 val A = new BlockMatrix(blocks, rowsPerBlock, colsPerBlock)
    
val PLU = A.blockLU
val P  = PLU._1
val L  = PLU._2
val U  = PLU._3

// computing a residual...
val residual = L.multiply(U).subtract(P.multiply(A))
val error = residual.toLocalMatrix.toArray.reduce(_ + Math.abs(_) ) 

println( "error : " + error.toString )
{% endhighlight %}

**How it Works**

The LU decomposition of $A$ can be written as four block matrices, given as
`\begin{align}
    PA & = LU\\
        \begin{pmatrix}
            P_1 A_{11}&P_1 A_{12} \\ 
            P_2 A_{21}&P_2 A_{22}
        \end{pmatrix} 
        & = \begin{pmatrix}
            L_{11}&0 \\ 
            L_{21}&L_{22}
            \end{pmatrix}
            \begin{pmatrix}
                U_{11}&U_{12} \\ 
                0&U_{22}
        \end{pmatrix} \\
        & =         \begin{pmatrix}
            L_{11}U_{11}&L_{11}U_{12} \\ 
            L_{21}U_{11}&L_{21}U_{12}+L_{22}U_{22}
            \end{pmatrix}.
        \label{eq:basicLUBlockDecomposition}
\end{align}`

Once the blocks are defined, we can then solve each matrix quadrant individually.  

`\begin{align}
P_1 A_{11} & = L_{11}U_{11}               & \Rightarrow  & (P_{1},L_{11},U_{11})  & = & \text{LU}_{LOCAL}(A_{11}) \label{eq:A11Solve} \\
P_1 A_{12} & = L_{11}U_{12}               & \Rightarrow  & U_{12}               & = & L_{11}^{-1}P_1 A_{12} \label{eq:U12Solve} \\
P_2 A_{21} & = L_{21}U_{11}               & \Rightarrow  & L_{21}               & = &P_2 A_{21}U_{11}^{-1} \label{eq:L21Solve}\\
P_2 A_{22} & = L_{21}U_{12}+L_{22}U_{22}  & \Rightarrow  & (P_{2},L_{22},U_{22})  & = & \text{LU}_{RECURSIVE}(S) \label{eq:A22Solve}\\
\end{align}`

where $A_{11}$ is chosen to be a single block, so that the Breeze library can be called to compute 
$\eqref{eq:A11Solve}$.  The Breeze library will return the $P_{1},L_{11}$ and $U_{11}$ matrices.  


Equation $\eqref{eq:A22Solve}$ is a recursive call that generates successive calculations of the Schur Complement, 
given as 
 
`\begin{equation}
S = A_{22} - L_{21} U_{12}.
\label{eq:SchurComplementInitialForm}
\end{equation}`

In this form, there is a dependency on the calculation of $\eqref{eq:A11Solve}$.  An equivalent form of the Schur 
complement can be used by substituting equations $\eqref{eq:U12Solve}$ and $\eqref{eq:L21Solve}$, giving

`\begin{equation}
S = A_{22} - A_{21} A_{11}^{-1} A_{12}, 
\label{eq:SchurComplementFinalForm}
\end{equation}`

which allows for the calculation of equation $\eqref{eq:A22Solve}$ with no dependency on equation 
$\eqref{eq:A11Solve}$, resulting in a slight increase in parallelism at the expense of recomputing the inverse of
$A_{11}$ on a separate process.  

Equations $\eqref{eq:U12Solve}$ and $\eqref{eq:L21Solve}$ are computed with 
[`BlockMatrix.multiply()`](api/scala/index.html#org.apache.spark.mllib.linalg.distributed.BlockMatrix) operations.  
The Schur Complement in $\eqref{eq:A22Solve}$ is computed using $\eqref{eq:SchurComplementFinalForm}$ with a 
[`BlockMatrix.multiply()`](api/scala/index.html#org.apache.spark.mllib.linalg.distributed.BlockMatrix) 
operation and passed recursively to the next iteration.  In this way, $P_2$ is never explicitly calculated, 
but is built up as a set of $P_1$ matrices.  The computation completes when the Schur Complement is a single block.

Instead of building the solution incrementally, and using more frequent but smaller block matrix operations, we construct large [`BlockMatrix`](api/scala/index.html#org.apache.spark.mllib.linalg.distributed.BlockMatrix) structures, and carry out the multiplication at the end of the calculation.  This should leverage the optimizations present in the [`BlockMatrix.multiply()`](api/scala/index.html#org.apache.spark.mllib.linalg.distributed.BlockMatrix) routine more effectively.  The matrices formed to carry out the operations are described int the in the figure below.

The Matrix multiply operations shown in the figure are generalizations of equations $\eqref{eq:A11Solve}$, $\eqref{eq:U12Solve}$, and $\eqref{eq:L21Solve}$.

#Solving a Linear System of Equations
[`BlockMatrix.solve()`](api/scala/index.html#org.apache.spark.mllib.linalg.distributed.BlockMatrix) calls the LU Factorization
method to solve the linear system of equations $AX=B$ for $X$.
The method of forward substitution solution is used.  This method is is described 
[`here`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triangular_matrix#Forward_and_back_substitution), for elements of a matrix, and 
and the generalization to blocks for the [`BlockMatrix.solve()`](api/scala/index.html#org.apache.spark.mllib.linalg.distributed.BlockMatrix)
is described briefly here.  

For a Linear system of equations $AX=B$, where $A$ is an $N \times N$ matrix, and $X$ and $B$ are  
[`BlockMatrix`](api/scala/index.html#org.apache.spark.mllib.linalg.distributed.BlockMatrix) objects of with $N$ 
row blocks and $W$ column blocks.  $B$ can have any number of columns, including 1.  The number of row and columns 
per block (`rowsPerBlock` and `colsPerBlock`) must be the same, however.  [`BlockMatrix.solve(B)`](api/scala/index.html#org.apache.spark.mllib.linalg.distributed.BlockMatrix)  
will return $X$ as a [`BlockMatrix`](api/scala/index.html#org.apache.spark.mllib.linalg.distributed.BlockMatrix) object
with the same dimensions of $B$.

The forward substitution equations are straightforward do obtain in two steps.  The equation $AX=B$  
can be expressed as $LUX=\widehat{B}$, where $\widehat{B}=PB$.  First, the solution to $LY=\widehat{B}$ for $Y$ is obtained, followed by 
solving $UX=Y$ for $X$.

Expanding $LY=\widehat{B}$ as [`BlockMatrix.multiply()`](api/scala/index.html#org.apache.spark.mllib.linalg.distributed.BlockMatrix)
operations gives

`\begin{align}
\widehat{B}_m &=& \sum_{i=1}^{m}L_{m,i}Y_m \\
 &=& L_{m,m}Y_m + \sum_{i=1}^{m-1}L_{m,i}Y_m. \\
\end{align}`

The solution for the $m$th row of $Y$ (which contains $W$ column elements) in terms of previous rows with the following
recurrence relation

`\begin{equation}
Y_m = L_{m,m}^{-1}\left [  \widehat{B}_m-\sum_{i=1}^{m}L_{m,i}Y_m\right ].\\
\end{equation}`

Once $Y$ is obtained, a similar method is applied to solve $UX=Y$.  Here we build the solution from the last row block, 
so the indexing is reversed.  Letting $\widetilde{m}=N-m+1$ and expanding the multiplication terms gives


`\begin{align}
Y_{\widetilde{m}} &=& \sum_{i=\widetilde{m}}^{N}U_{\widetilde{m},i}X_{\widetilde{m}} \\
 &=& U_{\widetilde{m},\widetilde{m}}X_{\widetilde{m}} + \sum_{i=\widetilde{m}+1}^{N}U_{\widetilde{m},i}X_{\widetilde{m}}. \\
\end{align}`

$X$ is obtained, starting with the bottom row block as $\widetilde{m}=N$ and incrementing to $\widetilde{m}=1$, using  

`\begin{equation}
X_\widetilde{m} = U_{\widetilde{m},\widetilde{m}}^{-1}\left[ Y_{\widetilde{m}}-\sum_{i=\widetilde{m}+1}^{N}U_{\widetilde{m},i}X_\widetilde{m}\right ].\\
\end{equation}`

val A = new BlockMatrix(blocks, 2, 2)

val B: BlockMatrix = ....// a BlockMatrix with the same number of rows as A

val X = A.solve(B)
val residual = A.multiply(X).subtract(B)
val error = residual.toLocalMatrix.toArray.reduce(_ + Math.abs(_))
println("error" + error.toString)
