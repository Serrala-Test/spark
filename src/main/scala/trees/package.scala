/**
 * A library for easily manipulating trees of operators.  Operators that extend TreeNode are granted the following
 * interface:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Scala collection like methods (foreach, map, flatMap, collect, etc)</li>
 *   <li>transform - accepts a partial function that is used to generate a new tree.  When the partial function can be
 *   applied to a given tree segment, that segment is replaced with the result.  After attempting to apply the partial
 *   function to a given node, the transform function recursively attempts to apply the function to that nodeâ€™s
 *   children.</li>
 *   <li>debugging support - pretty printing, easy splicing of trees, etc.</li>
 * </ul>
