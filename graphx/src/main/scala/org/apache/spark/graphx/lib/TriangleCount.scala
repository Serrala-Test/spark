/**
 * Compute the number of triangles passing through each vertex.
 *
 * The algorithm is relatively straightforward and can be computed in three steps:
 *
 * <ul>
 * <li>Compute the set of neighbors for each vertex
 * <li>For each edge compute the intersection of the sets and send the count to both vertices.
 * <li> Compute the sum at each vertex and divide by two since each triangle is counted twice.
 * </ul>
 *
 * Note that the input graph should have its edges in canonical direction
 * (i.e. the `sourceId` less than `destId`). Also the graph must have been partitioned
 * using [[org.apache.spark.graphx.Graph#partitionBy]].
