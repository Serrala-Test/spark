    A simple pipeline, which acts as an estimator. A Pipeline consists
    of a sequence of stages, each of which is either an
    :py:class:`Estimator` or a :py:class:`Transformer`. When
    :py:meth:`Pipeline.fit` is called, the stages are executed in
    order. If a stage is an :py:class:`Estimator`, its
    :py:meth:`Estimator.fit` method will be called on the input
    dataset to fit a model. Then the model, which is a transformer,
    will be used to transform the dataset as the input to the next
    stage. If a stage is a :py:class:`Transformer`, its
    :py:meth:`Transformer.transform` method will be called to produce
    the dataset for the next stage. The fitted model from a
    :py:class:`Pipeline` is an :py:class:`PipelineModel`, which
    consists of fitted models and transformers, corresponding to the
    pipeline stages. If there are no stages, the pipeline acts as an
    identity transformer.
