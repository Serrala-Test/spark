=====================
Supported pandas APIs
=====================

.. currentmodule:: pyspark.pandas

The following table shows the pandas APIs that implemented or non-implemented from pandas API on
Spark.

Some pandas APIs do not implement full parameters, so the third column shows missing parameters for
each API.

'Y' in the second column means it's implemented including its whole parameter.
'N' means it's not implemented yet.
'P' means it's partially implemented with the missing of some parameters.

If there is non-implemented pandas API or parameter you want, you can create an `Apache Spark
JIRA <https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/SPARK/summary>`__ to request or to contribute by your
own.

The API list is updated based on the `latest pandas official API
reference <https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/index.html#>`__.

All implemented APIs listed here are distributed except the ones that requires the local
computation by design. For example, `DataFrame.to_numpy() <https://spark.apache.org
/docs/latest/api/python/reference/pyspark.pandas/api/pyspark.pandas.DataFrame.
to_numpy.html>`__ requires to collect the data to the driver side.
